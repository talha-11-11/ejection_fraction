# Coronary Artery Disease Stage Predictor ðŸ«€

This project uses a machine learning model to predict the **ejection fraction (EF)** of the left ventricle based on user inputs like age, blood pressure, LDL, heart rate, and Troponin I levels.

It also classifies the **coronary artery disease stage** based on the EF:

- **Normal:** EF 50â€“70%
- **Mild:** EF 40â€“49%
- **Moderate:** EF 30â€“39%
- **Severe:** EF < 30%
